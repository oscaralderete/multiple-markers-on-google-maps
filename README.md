# Multiple markers on Google maps for WP
WordPress plugin to render a Google map containing multiple clickable markers on your WP site. This is the really easy way to deal with Google Maps.

You only need a valid Google Maps API key, actually the map will be functional without the API key but it will get that ugly semi-transparent div over your map saying something like: 'For development porpuses only'.

The plugin gets its own settings page inside WP admin zone (that runs seamlessly thanks to Vue 3) where you can define all markers you want, the height of your map and the Google Maps API key.

Place the next shortcode [MultiMarkersOnGmap] on everywhere you want to display your map, that's all.

Enjoy it!
