# multiple-markers-on-google-maps
WordPress plugin to render a Google map containing multiple clickable markers on your WP site. This is the really easy way to deal with Google Maps.
You only need a valid Google Maps API key, actually the map will be functional without the API key but it will get that ugly semi-transparent div over your map saying something like: 'For development porpuses only'.
